For example, sellers may need to complete an additional registration process. These Terms apply to sellers, but these Terms alone do not give you permission to use our Services as a seller.

We do not transfer, and are not responsible for transferring, legal ownership or physical possession of property from the seller to the buyer.

7.6 We may facilitate communication or payment between buyers, prospective buyers, bidders, and sellers in connection with some property. However, such Services are offered for convenience only. We have no agency authority and are not the agent of any buyer, prospective buyer, bidder or seller for any purpose. Our involvement in any sale transaction is limited to providing this marketplace, and, in some cases, accepting payment from the buyer on behalf of the seller in connection with the sale of some property. We may, but are not obligated to, provide intermediary services between buyers, prospective buyers, bidders, and sellers in connection with customer service or dispute resolution matters. In the event we elect in our sole discretion to provide intermediary services, we will attempt to help you resolve disputes in good faith and based solely on our interpretation of our policies, in our sole discretion; we will not make judgments regarding legal issues or claims. Our decision is final and binding on all parties and cannot be appealed, challenged or reversed.

7.7 We do not endorse or control and are not responsible for the conduct (whether online or offline) of any buyer, prospective buyer, bidder or seller. We make no representations or warranties as to the character, reputation, policies or practices of any buyer, prospective buyer, bidder or seller. We make no representations or warranties that any buyer, prospective buyer, bidder or seller will complete any transaction or otherwise perform as promised (whether or not we collect or agree to collect payment from any buyer on behalf of any seller).

7.8 We do not endorse or make any representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, with respect to: (i) Users' listings on our Services or related User Content, whether as to accuracy, completeness, truthfulness, reliability or otherwise; or (ii) any property listed, marketed, offered or sold (whether online or offline) by any User and/or third party, whether as to quality, size, condition, description, provenance, attribution, authenticity, legality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or otherwise.
